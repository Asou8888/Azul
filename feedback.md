## Tutor Comment

Good job! You have got most of the challenge finished, and your coding style is quite professional. Having solid comments and 
docs is always a good way to keep everyone on the same page. You have also made good use of Git. About the game implement, 
the classes you have been separated properly, and you have made good use of the build-in functions we have in Java, which is really nice.
For future improvement, there are several points you could consider to work on later:

- I see you have the `DecisionTree` class to solve the task 13. It would be nice if you could try to work on this later to integrate it into your game. 
- About the GUI design, it would be better if you could include a simple menu for users with no background knowledge to use. It's an easy solution to improve user experience.
- There are some redundancies in your code. Some methods and constructors are created but never touched. It would be better if you could remove them.

Overall, you guys have done really well on this assignment, and I can see from your comments that you have thought throughly during the developing process.
I hope you all enjoyed the learning process :)

-     * Given an entire game State, determine whether the state is valid.
-     * A game state is valid if it satisfies the following conditions.
-     * <p>
-     * [General]
-     * 1. The game state is well-formed.
-     * 2. There are no more than 20 of each colour of tile across all player
-     * areas, factories, bag and discard
-     * 3. Exactly one first player token 'f' must be present across all player
-     * boards and the centre.
-     * <p>
-     * [Mosaic]
-     * 1. No two tiles occupy the same location on a single player's mosaic.
-     * 2. Each row contains only 1 of each colour of tile.
-     * 3. Each column contains only 1 of each colour of tile.
-     * [Storage]
-     * 1. The maximum number of tiles stored in a row must not exceed (row_number + 1).
-     * 2. The colour of tile stored in a row must not be the same as a colour
-     * already found in the corresponding row of the mosaic.
-     * <p>
-     * [Floor]
-     * 1. There are no more than 7 tiles on a single player's floor.
-     * [Centre]
-     * 1. The number of tiles in the centre is no greater than 3 * the number of empty factories.
