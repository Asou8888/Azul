declaration: >-
  I submit the work below for assessment as my best work. I declare that this
  is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

# Use this to list any code that you used that you did not write,
# aside from code provided by the lecturer.  Provide a comment
# explaining your use and the URL to that code and the licence for
# that code



# I wish to submit the following methods as entirely my own (remove this if
# you want to just submit classes):
method:
   - private double[] findPosition()
   - The method could get the list of double which include x postion and
     y position of tile slot on board corresponding to the dragging tile, and the ints representing Storage, Floor and Mosaic for players.
   - By using the absolute x and y position of dragging tile, I set limits length and width for each member, and use for loop to
     collect the valid x and y position and record which member it is currently in.
   - it is nessassary to add the representing ints as later we need to crate a String move and use it via Azul.isValidMove() and
     Azul.applyMove().
