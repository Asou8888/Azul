declaration: >-
  I submit the work below for assessment as my best work. I declare that this
  is entirely my own work, with the following documented exceptions:

# Use this to list names of people who you collaborated with, and a
# comment about what you collaborated on.
#

# Use this to list any code that you used that you did not write,
# aside from code provided by the lecturer.  Provide a comment
# explaining your use and the URL to that code and the licence for
# that code
#



# I wish to submit the following methods as entirely my own (remove this if
# you want to just submit classes):
method:
   - public static Boolean isFull(String privateState)
   - This method is used for determine whether the game is over or not. If there is
   at least one row is full, the current round will over. It is also worked as part of NextRound(task8)
   to determine if the game is over.

   The parameter of this method is privateState (playerState of one player. example "A7Md03c13b23e32S4e1Fef").
   1. find the code of mosaic of the privateState, store as String mosaic (example Md03c13b23e32)
   2. exact all the number of mosaic ,which is the coordinate of the tiles. (example 03132332)
   3. check if there is 5 continuous coordinates (example 0102030405), which represent a row. (example 03132332 does not contain continous coordinate)
   4. return true if there is and false if there is not. (example false)
